# Escrow Contract

Secure fund custody for buyer-seller transactions with optional arbiter dispute resolution.

## Interface

```rust
fn create_escrow(buyer, seller, arbiter, token, amount, timeout) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
fn deposit(escrow_id) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn release(escrow_id) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn release_partial(escrow_id, amount) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn refund(escrow_id) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn refund_expired(escrow_id) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn dispute(escrow_id, claimant) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn resolve(escrow_id, in_favor_of_seller) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn cancel(escrow_id) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn get_status(escrow_id) -> Result<EscrowStatus, ForgeError>
fn get_escrow(escrow_id) -> Result<EscrowData, ForgeError>
fn escrows_for_participant(participant, cursor, limit) -> ParticipantEscrowsPage
fn touch_ttl(escrow_id) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
```

## Participant Index and Pagination

Each distinct buyer, seller, and arbiter receives a persistent participant
index in creation order. Creating an escrow adds its id once to each distinct
party's list. Cancelling a `Pending` escrow removes its id from all of those
lists after the status and buyer-authorization checks succeed. Removal keeps
the remaining ids in their original relative order. `release`, `refund`, and
`resolve` do not remove ids: those terminal escrow records remain addressable
through `get_escrow` and participant views. Thus the index contains every
non-cancelled escrow record, whether pending, funded, or terminal.

`escrows_for_participant` uses live offset pagination over the current
compacted list. `cursor` is an index offset at the moment of the call, not a
snapshot token. If cancellation removes an id before a cursor returned by a
previous page, later ids shift left and continuing from that saved cursor can
skip an id. Clients that need a complete view after an intervening mutation
should restart at cursor `0`. Without mutation, replaying `next_cursor` yields
every indexed id exactly once in creation order. `limit == 0`, cursors past
the end, and `u32::MAX` cursor/limit values return an empty terminal page
without overflow.

The invariant is maintained in the successful cancel path only: missing ids,
non-`Pending` records, and failed authorization do not alter either party's
index. No entrypoint signatures or generated TypeScript ABI changed.

## Lifecycle

```text
Pending --deposit--> Funded --release_partial (×n)--> Funded  (partial)
                    |                                  |
                    |                                  +--> Completed (final partial)
                    |        --release--> Completed (full, direct)
                    |        --refund--> Refunded   (buyer back, remaining only)
                    |        --refund_expired--> Refunded (permissionless keeper post-deadline)
                    |        --dispute--> Disputed --resolve--> Completed | Refunded
         --cancel--> Cancelled (before funding only)
```

## Permissionless expiry refunds

After `created_at + timeout`, any account can call `refund_expired` to transfer
the full escrow amount to the buyer. The boundary is strict: the ledger
timestamp must be greater than the deadline. At the exact deadline, only the
existing party-authorized `refund` path is available; that path's behavior is
unchanged. `refund_expired` accepts only `Funded` escrows, so a recorded
`Disputed` state remains frozen. The token transfer happens before the state
update, and the separate `RefundExpired` event identifies keeper-triggered
settlements to indexers.

The caller pays the transaction fee and receives no bounty; the call cannot
redirect funds or produce repeated state changes. Its only successful effect
is the same terminal refund to the buyer as the existing refund path. An
already-recorded dispute or terminal state is rejected without moving funds.

## States

- `Pending` — Created but not funded
- `Funded` — Funds deposited; partial releases may be applied
- `Completed` — Released to seller (full release or final partial release)
- `Refunded` — Remaining balance returned to buyer
- `Disputed` — Under arbitration (remaining balance frozen)
- `Cancelled` — Cancelled before funding

`RefundExpired` is emitted for permissionless keeper refunds, separately from
the party-triggered `Refunded` event.
## Partial Release

`release_partial(escrow_id, amount)` allows the seller to receive the escrow
balance incrementally while the escrow remains `Funded`.

### Accounting

```text
remaining = deposited - released
deposited = amount field set at create_escrow
released  = cumulative amount transferred to seller via release_partial
```

- Each successful `release_partial` call:
  1. Validates `status == Funded`, `amount > 0`, `amount <= remaining`
  2. Transfers exactly `amount` to the seller (transfer-before-state)
  3. Increments `released` by `amount`
  4. If `amount == remaining`: transitions to `Completed`
- `release` (the original full-release entrypoint) pays the **remaining** balance
  in one call and is backward-compatible — it behaves identically to before
  when no partial releases have been made.
- `refund` and `resolve` operate on the **remaining** balance only.
- `dispute` freezes the **remaining** balance.

### Authorization

`release_partial` is seller-authorized. Invalid requests (wrong status,
non-positive amount, amount exceeding remaining) return `InvalidInput` and
do not modify any storage.

### Events

`release_partial` emits `PartiallyReleased` (not `Released`). The event
carries `partial_amount` (the incremental transfer) and the full `EscrowData`
(including updated `released` and `status`). The existing `Released` event
remains exclusively for the `release` entrypoint and signals terminal
completion to indexers.

## Permissionless Expiry Refund Keeper

`refund_expired(escrow_id)` provides a permissionless entrypoint allowing any
caller, keeper bot, or automated cron sweep to trigger an expired escrow refund
to the buyer without requiring party authorization signatures.

### Mechanics & Invariants

1. **Authorization-Free**: Unlike `refund(escrow_id)` (which requires seller auth
   pre-deadline or buyer auth post-deadline), `refund_expired` requires no caller
   signatures. Any third party can execute the sweep.
2. **Payout Recipient**: All refunded funds are sent strictly to the recorded
   `buyer` address. The caller/keeper cannot redirect or claim any portion of the
   escrow principal.
3. **Conservation**: Operates on remaining balance (`amount - released`),
   preserving accounting when prior `release_partial` calls occurred.
4. **State Transition**: Sets `status = Refunded`, `released = amount`, and bumps
   the persistent entry TTL to `PERSISTENT_BUMP_LEDGERS`.
5. **Event**: Emits a dedicated `RefundExpired` contract event with topic
   `refund_expired` and `escrow_id`, distinct from `Refunded`, allowing indexers
   and monitoring services to attribute keeper-driven sweeps cleanly.

### Anti-Griefing Boundary Analysis

The entrypoint pins strict boundary conditions to protect sellers and arbiters
against premature sweeps, front-running, or dispute circumvention:

- **Strict Post-Deadline Inequality (`now > deadline`)**:
  - `deadline = created_at + timeout`.
  - Calling at `now < deadline` or `now == deadline` is rejected with
    `ForgeError::DeadlineReached`.
  - Sellers have until the exact boundary second (`now == deadline`) to confirm
    delivery or initiate a dispute. Keepers cannot sweep at the boundary second.
- **Dispute Freeze Protection**:
  - Escrows in `EscrowStatus::Disputed` reject `refund_expired` with
    `ForgeError::InvalidInput`.
  - Once a dispute is raised by either party, arbitration freeze is absolute: a
    third party cannot bypass the arbiter by waiting out the deadline. Only
    `resolve` may settle a disputed escrow.
- **Status Gating**:
  - Calling on `Pending` escrows (before deposit) rejects with `ForgeError::InvalidInput`.
  - Calling on terminal escrows (`Completed`, `Refunded`, `Cancelled`) rejects with
    `ForgeError::InvalidInput`.
- **Transfer-Before-State Safety**:
  - Payout via SEP-41 token transfer executes before mutating storage state. If the
    token contract fails or reverts, the escrow record remains unaltered in `Funded` state.

## Storage Compatibility

`EscrowData` now carries a `released: i128` field. Records written by
earlier contract versions do not contain this field.

**Strategy**: two-type fallback decode in `load_escrow`.
1. Attempt deserialization as current `EscrowData` (10 fields including `released`).
2. On failure, attempt as `EscrowDataV1` (9 fields, no `released`).
3. Convert `EscrowDataV1` → `EscrowData` by defaulting `released = 0`.

This works because Soroban `#[contracttype]` structs are stored as XDR
symbol-keyed maps. The host rejects deserialization when the map's entry count
differs from the struct's field count; old 9-field records fail step 1 and
succeed at step 2. `EscrowDataV1` is a read-only migration type; new code
never writes it. Lazy migration: the first state-changing call on an old record
writes the current schema back.

`DataKey::Escrow(id)` is unchanged.
