# Subscription Payments Contract

Recurring, on-chain subscription billing: a subscriber authorizes a provider to
pull a fixed `amount` per `period` (seconds) through SEP-41 token transfers.

## Interface

```rust
fn subscribe(subscriber, provider, token, amount, period) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
fn subscribe_on_behalf_of(provider, subscriber, token, amount, period) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
fn authorize_provider(subscriber, provider) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn revoke_provider(subscriber, provider) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn is_provider_authorized(subscriber, provider) -> bool
fn charge(subscription_id) -> Result<i128, ForgeError>
fn deposit(subscription_id, amount) -> Result<i128, ForgeError>
fn withdraw_balance(subscription_id, amount) -> Result<i128, ForgeError>
fn charge_catchup(subscription_id, max_periods: u32) -> Result<i128, ForgeError>
fn set_quotas(subscription_id, quotas: Vec<MetricQuota>) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn record_usage(subscription_id, metric: Symbol, units: u64) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn quote_period(subscription_id) -> Result<i128, ForgeError>
fn cancel(subscription_id) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn get_subscription(subscription_id) -> Result<Subscription, ForgeError>
fn get_usage(subscription_id, metric: Symbol) -> Result<UsageRecord, ForgeError>
fn get_subscription_count() -> u64
fn subscriptions_for_subscriber(subscriber, offset, limit) -> Result<Vec<Subscription>, ForgeError>
fn subscriptions_for_provider(provider, offset, limit) -> Result<Vec<Subscription>, ForgeError>
// Plan registry (issue #116)
fn create_plan(provider, token, amount, period, quotas: Vec<MetricQuota>) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
fn subscribe_to_plan(plan_id, subscriber) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
fn get_plan(plan_id) -> Result<Plan, ForgeError>
fn plan_count() -> u64
```

- `subscribe` requires the subscriber and returns a stable, monotonic id.
- `charge` requires the provider and settles at most one full period per call.
- `deposit` requires the subscriber. The first successful deposit opts that
  subscription into prepaid mode; deposits pull the exact amount into contract
  custody before writing the new balance. `get_subscription` exposes
  `prepaid_balance`: `None` is pull mode, while `Some(0)` remains opted in.
- In prepaid mode, `charge` still requires the provider and transfers exactly
  one derived period amount from contract custody to the provider. If the
  balance cannot cover it, no partial transfer occurs and the existing retry
  policy moves the subscription to `PastDue` (and auto-cancels after three
  failed attempts). Depositing while `PastDue` allows the next `charge` retry
  to recover it. `charge_catchup` rejects prepaid subscriptions so it cannot
  bypass this one-period lapse policy by pulling from the subscriber.
- `withdraw_balance` requires the subscriber and returns a requested amount
  before cancellation. It does not turn prepaid mode off. `cancel` returns the
  exact remaining balance to the subscriber before recording cancellation;
  retry-limit auto-cancellation also returns the remainder.
- `charge_catchup` requires the provider and settles `min(max_periods,
elapsed_periods)` periods in one atomic invocation. `max_periods == 0` is a
  no-op; values above the hard cap of 32 are rejected. The cap bounds Soroban
  instruction use and token outlay for keeper calls.
- `charge_catchup` refuses `PastDue`; call `charge` to use the existing retry
  policy. A failed catch-up transfer returns `TokenTransferFailed` and rolls
  back all transfers and `last_charged` through Soroban frame rollback.
- `cancel` requires the subscriber and prevents further charges.
- `set_quotas`, `record_usage`, and the metering views are described under
  [Metered usage](#metered-usage-quotas-and-overage).

## Metered usage: quotas and overage

A subscription can declare up to 16 per-metric quotas, so a period bills
`amount` plus overage for real consumption. **No quotas means the original flat
flow**: the charged amount and every event payload are identical to a contract
without this feature.

```rust
struct MetricQuota {
    metric: Symbol,             // e.g. api_calls
    included_units: u64,         // covered by the base `amount`
    overage_price: i128,        // per started bucket
    bucket_units: u64,             // units per bucket, must be > 0
    max_overage_units: Option<u64>, // cap on billable overage units
}
```

The billable amount for one period is derived in a single pure helper used by
`charge`, by every period of `charge_catchup`, and by `quote_period`:

```text
amount = base
       + Σ over metric of ceil(min(max(0, units - included), cap) / bucket) * overage_price
```

with the `min` skipped for an uncapped quota.

- `set_quotas` requires the **subscriber** — a quota prices what the subscriber
  is billed, so the charged account consents to the terms. It is rejected unless
  the subscription is `Active` and the open period has no recorded usage, so
  already-metered units can never be repriced mid-period. An empty list returns
  the subscription to flat pricing.
- `record_usage` requires the **provider**, mirroring who may `charge`, and
  rejects a metric the subscription does not declare, so usage the subscriber
  has not been asked to pay for can never be billed.
- `record_usage` accumulates **raw units** for the open period only, so each
  period's amount is a pure function of that period's units: charging `N
  periods bills exactly `N` times the per-period derivation, and no rounding can
  compound across periods. A bucket is billed once started (rounded up), and the
  price is per bucket, never per unit.
- Meters are dropped atomically with the charge that closes the period, in
  the same frame that advances `last_charged`. A failed transfer returns before that
  point, so every meter survives and the arrears retry re-derives an identical
  amount.
- `charge_catchup` settles the open period **last**: usage can only be metered
  into the open (latest) period, so earlier unsettled periods bill the base
  amount and only the final one carries overage.
- `record_usage` requires `Active`, which freezes the meter at the attempted
  amount once a charge has failed, so the `PastDue` retry is identical to the
  attempt that failed.
- Caps are enforced by clamping at settlement, never by rejecting, so a usage
  spike cannot wedge a subscription; the subscriber's worst case per period is
  `base + Σ caps`. A `u64` unit-counter overflow surfaces as
  `ArithmeticOverflow` rather than wrapping into a silent underbill.

## Subscription States

- `Active` — chargeable
- `Cancelled` — no further charges
- `PastDue` — a failed single-period payment requiring `charge` retry semantics

## Prepaid money flow

Only a successful `deposit` opts in. Subscriptions that never deposit retain
the existing pull flow and `prepaid_balance == None`.

| State / operation | Token movement | Balance effect |
|---|---|---|
| Pull mode `charge` | subscriber → provider, exact derived period amount | no prepaid balance |
| Prepaid `deposit` | subscriber → contract, exact requested amount | add amount after transfer succeeds |
| Prepaid `charge`, sufficient balance | contract → provider, exact derived period amount | subtract amount after transfer succeeds |
| Prepaid `charge`, insufficient balance | none | unchanged; retry state advances to `PastDue` or retry-limit cancellation |
| `withdraw_balance` | contract → subscriber, exact requested amount | subtract amount after transfer succeeds |
| `cancel` / retry-limit auto-cancel | contract → subscriber, full remaining balance | set to `Some(0)` after refund succeeds |

The conservation invariant is `Σdeposits − Σperiod debits ‒ Σwithdrawals ‒
Σcancellation refunds == prepaid_balance` after every successful operation.
The randomized lifecycle property test compares each operation with an
independent balance/state mirror and also checks the SEP-41 contract balance.
Every successful deposit, period debit, and refund emits `Deposited`,
`BalanceDebited`, or `BalanceRefunded` with `amount` and `balance_after`.

Prepaid mode introduces a custody trust surface: deposited tokens stay in the
contract until periods are charged or the subscriber withdraws/cancels. The
pull mode remains direct subscriber-to-provider settlement. The subscription
record gains an optional `prepaid_balance` field; ABI clients must be regenerated
for this record shape change.

## Secondary Indices

Each subscription is indexed in two secondary lists, written on the `subscribe`
success path:

- `SubscriberSubscriptions(subscriber)` — creation-order subscription ids for
  which the address is the subscriber.
- `ProviderSubscriptions(provider)` — creation-order subscription ids for which
  the address is the provider.

The indices store lightweight `Vec<u64>` id lists; full `Subscription` records
are only loaded for the requested page slice.

## View Methods

- `get_subscription_count()` returns the total number of subscriptions created
  (the monotonic id counter; cancellation never lowers it).
- `subscriptions_for_subscriber(subscriber, offset, limit)` returns a page of
  `Subscription` records for the subscriber, in creation order.
- `subscriptions_for_provider(provider, offset, limit)` returns a page of
  `Subscription` records for the provider, in creation order.

Both enumeration methods are read-only (no authorization, no storage writes).
`offset` skips the first `offset` subscriptions and `limit` caps the page size:
an empty index or an out-of-bounds offset yields an empty `Vec`, and a `limit`
of `0` fails with `ForgeError::InvalidInput`.

## Storage

- `Subscription(id)` — the record for id `u64`.
- `Count` — monotonic subscription id counter.
- `SubscriberSubscriptions(address)` — subscriber id index.
- `ProviderSubscriptions(address)` — provider id index.
- `Usage(subscription_id, metric)` — the open period's raw unit counter for one
  metric, stamped with the `last_charged` window it belongs to; removed by the
  charge that closes the period.

## Payment Semantics

`charge` returns the billed amount, or `0` when no full period has elapsed since
the last charge. `charge_catchup` returns the total billed amount and advances
`last_charged` once per successfully settled period. Period and total arithmetic
uses checked operations. For a metered subscription the billed amount is the
derived `base + overage` amount rather than `amount` alone; it is computed
before the transfer, so an unrepresentable bill never moves funds.

## Events

The contract emits typed on-chain lifecycle events for indexers and off-chain monitoring:

- `Subscribed` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — emitted when a subscription is created via `subscribe`. Contains `subscriber`, `provider`, `token`, `amount`, and `period`.
- `Charged` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — emitted on successful billing via `charge` (one event) or `charge_catchup` (one event per settled period). Contains `amount`, `last_charged`, and `next_charge_at`. For a metered subscription `amount` is the derived `base + overage` amount, not the base alone.
- `UsageRecorded` (topics: `subscription_id: u64`, `metric: Symbol`) — emitted per `record_usage` call. Contains the `units` added, the running `period_units` for the open period, and the `period_start` window those units belong to, so an indexer can rebuild each settled period's overage.
- `QuotasSet` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — emitted when `set_quotas` replaces the declared terms. Contains the full `quotas` list, so the pricing an indexer needs travels with the event.
- `Deposited` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — successful prepaid deposit; contains `amount` and `balance_after`.
- `BalanceDebited` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — successful prepaid period settlement; contains the exact `amount` and `balance_after`.
- `BalanceRefunded` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — successful subscriber withdrawal or cancellation refund; contains `amount` and `balance_after`.
- `Cancelled` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — emitted when a subscription is cancelled via `cancel`. Contains `subscriber`.
- `Charged` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — emitted on successful billing via `charge` (one event) or `charge_catchup` (one event per settled period). Contains `amount`, `last_charged`, and `next_charge_at`.
- `Cancelled` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — emitted when a subscription is cancelled via `cancel`. Contains `subscriber`.


## Plan Registry

A provider can publish a reusable billing plan once and share its `plan_id`
with subscribers, who then self-serve without needing the token, amount, and
period out-of-band.

### Creating a plan

```rust
fn create_plan(provider, token, amount, period, quotas) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
```

- Requires the **provider's authorization**.
- Validates `amount > 0` and `period > 0` before auth, so invalid inputs never
  spend the provider's signature.
- `quotas` follows the same validation as `set_quotas`: at most 16 entries, no
  duplicate metrics, `bucket_units > 0`, `overage_price >= 0`. Pass an empty
  `Vec` for flat pricing.
- Returns a stable `plan_id` allocated from a **separate monotonic counter**
  (`DataKey::PlanCount`) so plan ids and subscription ids are in distinct
  namespaces and can never be confused.
- Plan ids are sequential starting from 1 and stable — they never change after
  creation.

### Subscribing to a plan

```rust
fn subscribe_to_plan(plan_id, subscriber) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
```

- Requires the **subscriber's authorization**.
- Looks up the plan; returns `ForgeError::NotFound` for an unknown `plan_id`.
- Creates a `Subscription` record with the plan's token, amount, period, and
  quotas copied verbatim. The subscription id is allocated from the **same**
  counter as `subscribe`, so all subscription ids are globally unique regardless
  of creation path.
- **A subscriber can hold multiple subscriptions to the same plan.** Each call
  creates a distinct record with its own `subscription_id`, `last_charged`
  timestamp, and independent lifecycle. This mirrors the existing behaviour of
  `subscribe`, which also creates a new record on every call even with the same
  provider.
- The resulting subscription is indistinguishable from one created via
  `subscribe`: it appears in both subscriber and provider secondary indexes,
  supports `charge`, `charge_catchup`, `pause`, `resume`, `cancel`,
  `set_quotas`, `record_usage`, and all views.

### Reading plan state

```rust
fn get_plan(plan_id) -> Result<Plan, ForgeError>  // no auth required
fn plan_count() -> u64                            // no auth required
```

- `get_plan` returns `ForgeError::NotFound` for an unknown id. No
  authorization required.
- `plan_count` returns the total number of plans created (the monotonic counter;
  it never decreases). No authorization required.

### Plan struct

```rust
struct Plan {
    plan_id:  u64,
    provider: Address,
    token:    Address,
    amount:   i128,
    period:   u64,
    quotas:   Vec<MetricQuota>,  // empty = flat pricing
}
```

### Authorization table (plan entrypoints)

| Entrypoint          | Required authorization |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `create_plan`       | provider               |
| `subscribe_to_plan` | subscriber             |
| `get_plan`          | none                   |
| `plan_count`        | none                   |

### Storage keys (plan registry)

- `Plan(plan_id: u64)` — the plan record.
- `PlanCount` — monotonic plan id counter (separate from `Count` used for
  subscriptions).
