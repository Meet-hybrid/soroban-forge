# Subscription Payments Contract

Recurring, on-chain subscription billing: a subscriber authorizes a provider to
pull a fixed `amount` per `period` (seconds) through SEP-41 token transfers.

## Interface

```rust
fn subscribe(subscriber, provider, token, amount, period) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
fn charge(subscription_id) -> Result<i128, ForgeError>
fn charge_catchup(subscription_id, max_periods: u32) -> Result<i128, ForgeError>
fn set_quotas(subscription_id, quotas: Vec<MetricQuota>) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn record_usage(subscription_id, metric: Symbol, units: u64) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn quote_period(subscription_id) -> Result<i128, ForgeError>
fn cancel(subscription_id) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn get_subscription(subscription_id) -> Result<Subscription, ForgeError>
fn get_usage(subscription_id, metric: Symbol) -> Result<UsageRecord, ForgeError>
fn get_subscription_count() -> u64
fn subscriptions_for_subscriber(subscriber, offset, limit) -> Result<Vec<Subscription>, ForgeError>
fn subscriptions_for_provider(provider, offset, limit) -> Result<Vec<Subscription>, ForgeError>
```

- `subscribe` requires the subscriber and returns a stable, monotonic id.
- `charge` requires the provider and settles at most one full period per call.
- `charge_catchup` requires the provider and settles `min(max_periods,
elapsed_periods)` periods in one atomic invocation. `max_periods == 0` is a
  no-op; values above the hard cap of 32 are rejected. The cap bounds Soroban
  instruction use and token outlay for keeper calls.
- `charge_catchup` refuses `PastDue`; call `charge` to use the existing retry
  policy. A failed catch-up transfer returns `TokenTransferFailed` and rolls
  back all transfers and `last_charged` through Soroban frame rollback.
- `cancel` requires the subscriber and prevents further charges.
- `set_quotas`, `record_usage`, and the metering views are described under
  [Metered usage](#metered-usage-quotas-and-overage).

## Metered usage: quotas and overage

A subscription can declare up to 16 per-metric quotas, so a period bills
`amount` plus overage for real consumption. **No quotas means the original flat
flow**: the charged amount and every event payload are identical to a contract
without this feature.

```rust
struct MetricQuota {
    metric: Symbol,             // e.g. api_calls
    included_units: u64,        // covered by the base `amount`
    overage_price: i128,        // per started bucket
    bucket_units: u64,          // units per bucket, must be > 0
    max_overage_units: Option<u64>, // cap on billable overage units
}
```

The billable amount for one period is derived in a single pure helper used by
`charge`, by every period of `charge_catchup`, and by `quote_period`:

```text
amount = base
       + Σ over metric of ceil(min(max(0, units - included), cap) / bucket) * overage_price
```

with the `min` skipped for an uncapped quota.

- `set_quotas` requires the **subscriber** — a quota prices what the subscriber
  is billed, so the charged account consents to the terms. It is rejected unless
  the subscription is `Active` and the open period has no recorded usage, so
  already-metered units can never be repriced mid-period. An empty list returns
  the subscription to flat pricing.
- `record_usage` requires the **provider**, mirroring who may `charge`, and
  rejects a metric the subscription does not declare, so usage the subscriber
  has not been asked to pay for can never be billed.
- `record_usage` accumulates **raw units** for the open period only, so each
  period's amount is a pure function of that period's units: charging `N`
  periods bills exactly `N` times the per-period derivation, and no rounding can
  compound across periods. A bucket is billed once started (rounded up), and the
  price is per bucket, never per unit.
- Meters are dropped atomically with the charge that closes the period, in the
  same frame that advances `last_charged`. A failed transfer returns before that
  point, so every meter survives and the arrears retry re-derives an identical
  amount.
- `charge_catchup` settles the open period **last**: usage can only be metered
  into the open (latest) period, so earlier unsettled periods bill the base
  amount and only the final one carries overage.
- `record_usage` requires `Active`, which freezes the meter at the attempted
  amount once a charge has failed, so the `PastDue` retry is identical to the
  attempt that failed.
- Caps are enforced by clamping at settlement, never by rejecting, so a usage
  spike cannot wedge a subscription; the subscriber's worst case per period is
  `base + Σ caps`. A `u64` unit-counter overflow surfaces as
  `ArithmeticOverflow` rather than wrapping into a silent underbill.

## Subscription States

- `Active` — chargeable
- `Cancelled` — no further charges
- `PastDue` — a failed single-period payment requiring `charge` retry semantics

## Secondary Indices

Each subscription is indexed in two secondary lists, written on the `subscribe`
success path:

- `SubscriberSubscriptions(subscriber)` — creation-order subscription ids for
  which the address is the subscriber.
- `ProviderSubscriptions(provider)` — creation-order subscription ids for which
  the address is the provider.

The indices store lightweight `Vec<u64>` id lists; full `Subscription` records
are only loaded for the requested page slice.

## View Methods

- `get_subscription_count()` returns the total number of subscriptions created
  (the monotonic id counter; cancellation never lowers it).
- `subscriptions_for_subscriber(subscriber, offset, limit)` returns a page of
  `Subscription` records for the subscriber, in creation order.
- `subscriptions_for_provider(provider, offset, limit)` returns a page of
  `Subscription` records for the provider, in creation order.

Both enumeration methods are read-only (no authorization, no storage writes).
`offset` skips the first `offset` subscriptions and `limit` caps the page size:
an empty index or an out-of-bounds offset yields an empty `Vec`, and a `limit`
of `0` fails with `ForgeError::InvalidInput`.

## Storage

- `Subscription(id)` — the record for id `u64`.
- `Count` — monotonic subscription id counter.
- `SubscriberSubscriptions(address)` — subscriber id index.
- `ProviderSubscriptions(address)` — provider id index.
- `RenewalPolicy(id)` — separate instance-storage record; the `Subscription`
  wire shape remains unchanged.
- `Usage(subscription_id, metric)` — the open period's raw unit counter for one
  metric, stamped with the `last_charged` window it belongs to; removed by the
  charge that closes the period.

## Payment Semantics

`charge` returns the billed amount, or `0` when no full period has elapsed since
the last charge. `charge_catchup` returns the total billed amount and advances
`last_charged` once per successfully settled period. Period and total arithmetic
uses checked operations. For a metered subscription the billed amount is the
derived `base + overage` amount rather than `amount` alone; it is computed
before the transfer, so an unrepresentable bill never moves funds.

## Events

The contract emits typed on-chain lifecycle events for indexers and off-chain monitoring:

- `Subscribed` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — emitted when a subscription is created via `subscribe`. Contains `subscriber`, `provider`, `token`, `amount`, and `period`.
- `Charged` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — emitted on successful billing via `charge` (one event) or `charge_catchup` (one event per settled period). Contains `amount`, `last_charged`, and `next_charge_at`. For a metered subscription `amount` is the derived `base + overage` amount, not the base alone.
- `UsageRecorded` (topics: `subscription_id: u64`, `metric: Symbol`) — emitted per `record_usage` call. Contains the `units` added, the running `period_units` for the open period, and the `period_start` window those units belong to, so an indexer can rebuild each settled period's overage.
- `QuotasSet` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — emitted when `set_quotas` replaces the declared terms. Contains the full `quotas` list, so the pricing an indexer needs travels with the event.
- `Cancelled` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — emitted when a subscription is cancelled via `cancel`. Contains `subscriber`.
- `RenewalPolicyChanged` reports subscriber policy changes; `max_renewals = 0`
  means unlimited.
- `Renewed` reports successful permissionless renewals and the completed
  renewal count; the ordinary `Charged` event is also emitted.

## Automatic Renewal

The subscriber enables or disables policy with `set_renewal_policy`.
`renew(subscription_id)` settles one elapsed period while the subscription
is active, policy is enabled, and the call lands between the due timestamp
and seven days after it (inclusive). A configured maximum is enforced; zero
means unlimited. A failed transfer returns `TokenTransferFailed` and leaves
the subscription and renewal counter unchanged. `get_renewal_policy` reports
the next due timestamp, current eligibility, and allowance expiry ledger.
Enabling policy approves this contract as a SEP-41 spender; finite renewal
counts are enforced independently by each subscription policy. Disabling a
policy closes that subscription's renewal gate, and the shared allowance is
revoked when no other active policy for the same subscriber and token remains.
The token's temporary allowance lives through its
maximum TTL, so the subscriber must re-enable policy after that ledger window
to continue automatic renewals. Policy uses a parallel key so the serialized
`Subscription` record does not change. Manual charges and renewals advance the
same `last_charged` value, preventing double settlement.
