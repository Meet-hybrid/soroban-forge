# Subscription Payments Contract

Recurring, on-chain subscription billing: a subscriber authorizes a provider to
pull a fixed `amount` per `period` (seconds) through SEP-41 token transfers.

## Interface

```rust
fn subscribe(subscriber, provider, token, amount, period) -> Result<u64, ForgeError>
fn charge(subscription_id) -> Result<i128, ForgeError>
fn charge_catchup(subscription_id, max_periods: u32) -> Result<i128, ForgeError>
fn cancel(subscription_id) -> Result<(), ForgeError>
fn get_subscription(subscription_id) -> Result<Subscription, ForgeError>
fn get_subscription_count() -> u64
fn subscriptions_for_subscriber(subscriber, offset, limit) -> Result<Vec<Subscription>, ForgeError>
fn subscriptions_for_provider(provider, offset, limit) -> Result<Vec<Subscription>, ForgeError>
```

- `subscribe` requires the subscriber and returns a stable, monotonic id.
- `charge` requires the provider and settles at most one full period per call.
- `charge_catchup` requires the provider and settles `min(max_periods,
elapsed_periods)` periods in one atomic invocation. `max_periods == 0` is a
  no-op; values above the hard cap of 32 are rejected. The cap bounds Soroban
  instruction use and token outlay for keeper calls.
- `charge_catchup` refuses `PastDue`; call `charge` to use the existing retry
  policy. A failed catch-up transfer returns `TokenTransferFailed` and rolls
  back all transfers and `last_charged` through Soroban frame rollback.
- `cancel` requires the subscriber and prevents further charges.

## Subscription States

- `Active` — chargeable
- `Cancelled` — no further charges
- `PastDue` — a failed single-period payment requiring `charge` retry semantics

## Secondary Indices

Each subscription is indexed in two secondary lists, written on the `subscribe`
success path:

- `SubscriberSubscriptions(subscriber)` — creation-order subscription ids for
  which the address is the subscriber.
- `ProviderSubscriptions(provider)` — creation-order subscription ids for which
  the address is the provider.

The indices store lightweight `Vec<u64>` id lists; full `Subscription` records
are only loaded for the requested page slice.

## View Methods

- `get_subscription_count()` returns the total number of subscriptions created
  (the monotonic id counter; cancellation never lowers it).
- `subscriptions_for_subscriber(subscriber, offset, limit)` returns a page of
  `Subscription` records for the subscriber, in creation order.
- `subscriptions_for_provider(provider, offset, limit)` returns a page of
  `Subscription` records for the provider, in creation order.

Both enumeration methods are read-only (no authorization, no storage writes).
`offset` skips the first `offset` subscriptions and `limit` caps the page size:
an empty index or an out-of-bounds offset yields an empty `Vec`, and a `limit`
of `0` fails with `ForgeError::InvalidInput`.

## Storage

- `Subscription(id)` — the record for id `u64`.
- `Count` — monotonic subscription id counter.
- `SubscriberSubscriptions(address)` — subscriber id index.
- `ProviderSubscriptions(address)` — provider id index.
- `RenewalPolicy(id)` — separate instance-storage record; the `Subscription`
  wire shape remains unchanged.

## Payment Semantics

`charge` returns the billed amount, or `0` when no full period has elapsed since
the last charge. `charge_catchup` returns the total billed amount and advances
`last_charged` once per successfully settled period. Period and total arithmetic
uses checked operations.

## Events

The contract emits typed on-chain lifecycle events for indexers and off-chain monitoring:

- `Subscribed` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — emitted when a subscription is created via `subscribe`. Contains `subscriber`, `provider`, `token`, `amount`, and `period`.
- `Charged` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — emitted on successful billing via `charge` (one event) or `charge_catchup` (one event per settled period). Contains `amount`, `last_charged`, and `next_charge_at`.
- `Cancelled` (topic: `subscription_id: u64`) — emitted when a subscription is cancelled via `cancel`. Contains `subscriber`.
- `RenewalPolicyChanged` reports subscriber policy changes; `max_renewals = 0`
  means unlimited.
- `Renewed` reports successful permissionless renewals and the completed
  renewal count; the ordinary `Charged` event is also emitted.

## Automatic Renewal

The subscriber enables or disables policy with `set_renewal_policy`.
`renew(subscription_id)` settles one elapsed period while the subscription
is active, policy is enabled, and the call lands between the due timestamp
and seven days after it (inclusive). A configured maximum is enforced; zero
means unlimited. A failed transfer returns `TokenTransferFailed` and leaves
the subscription and renewal counter unchanged. `get_renewal_policy` reports
the next due timestamp, current eligibility, and allowance expiry ledger.
Enabling policy approves this contract as a SEP-41 spender; finite renewal
counts are enforced independently by each subscription policy. Disabling a
policy closes that subscription's renewal gate, and the shared allowance is
revoked when no other active policy for the same subscriber and token remains.
The token's temporary allowance lives through its
maximum TTL, so the subscriber must re-enable policy after that ledger window
to continue automatic renewals. Policy uses a parallel key so the serialized
`Subscription` record does not change. Manual charges and renewals advance the
same `last_charged` value, preventing double settlement.
