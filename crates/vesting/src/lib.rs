//! # Soroban Forge — Vesting contract
//!
//! A token-vesting contract that releases a beneficiary's tokens over time.
//! Two schedule shapes share one id space and one claim path:
//!
//! - **linear** ([`VestingSchedule`], created by `create_schedule`) — an
//!   optional cliff followed by a straight-line ramp to `duration`;
//! - **tranche** ([`TrancheSchedule`], created by `create_tranche_schedule`) —
//!   an explicit, ordered table of discrete unlocks.
//!
//! The two are deliberately **not** merged into one record: the linear
//! record's wire shape and its floor-division math stay exactly as they were,
//! and a tranche schedule lives under its own `DataKey` variant.
//!
//! Timings in both shapes are expressed as **durations in seconds measured
//! from the schedule start** (the ledger timestamp recorded at creation).
//!
//! ## Linear shape
//!
//! ```text
//! start ......... start+cliff ................... start+duration
//!   |             (claims become possible)        (fully vested)
//!   |  Locked    |            Vesting (linear)  |
//! ```
//!
//! The vested amount at ledger time `t` is:
//! - `0` when `t < start + cliff`,
//! - `total_amount` when `t >= start + duration`,
//! - otherwise `total_amount * (t - (start + cliff)) / (duration - cliff)`,
//!   using integer (floor) division so claims never round up.
//!
//! ## Tranche shape
//!
//! A grant agreement of the form "25% at TGE, 25% at +6 months, 50% at +12
//! months" is not expressible as a ramp, so the tranche kind takes the unlock
//! table verbatim: an ordered list of [`Tranche`]s, each an offset from
//! `start` plus the amount that unlocks at it.
//!
//! ```text
//!        t1            t2                t3
//! start   |             |                 |
//!   |     |   tranche 1  |   tranche 2     |   tranche 3
//!   | Locked  (a1)         (a2)              (a3)
//!   |     |  vested:      vested:           vested:
//!   |     |     0  ->     a1  ->            a1+a2  ->  total
//!   +-----+--------------+------------------+---------.
//! ```
//!
//! Offsets are strictly increasing, so the vested amount is a **step function**
//! of the sum of every tranche whose offset has elapsed: `0` before `t1`,
//! `a1` between `t1` and `t2`, `a1 + a2` between `t2` and `t3`, and the full
//! total from `t3` on. Nothing accrues between unlocks, and the vested amount
//! never decreases, so a claim at any moment pays exactly the difference
//! since the last one.
//!
//! Unlock progress is compared on the *elapsed offset* rather than on
//! `start + unlock_at`, so an offset of `u64::MAX` cannot overflow: that
//! tranche simply never unlocks.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! Both kinds derive status from the same two inputs — ledger time and the
//! claimed amount: `Locked` before the first unlock, `Vesting` from the first
//! unlock until the final amount is claimed, `Completed` once `claimed ==
//! total_amount`. `Revoked` is reachable only through `revoke`, which
//! freezes the schedule (see *Revocation* below).
//!
//! Authorization model:
//! - `create_schedule` requires the beneficiary; its `funder` argument is
//!   recorded on the linear schedule without authorizing (mirroring escrow's
//!   non-consenting parties). `create_tranche_schedule` also requires its
//!   beneficiary.
//! - `revoke` requires the funder recorded at creation.
//! - `claim` requires the beneficiary.
//!
//! ## Revocation
//!
//! `revoke(schedule_id)` terminates a linear schedule before completion:
//! `Locked | Vesting -> Revoked`, permanently stopping further vesting.
//! Only the **funder** recorded at creation may revoke (`require_auth` on
//! it); the beneficiary cannot. The vested amount at the revocation ledger
//! timestamp is frozen into the record (`revoked_vested`): `claim` after
//! revocation succeeds only up to that amount — everything already vested
//! stays claimable — and `claimable` returns `0` once it is claimed.
//! Nothing after the revocation timestamp ever vests.
//!
//! Revoking a `Completed` or already-`Revoked` schedule is rejected with
//! [`ForgeError::InvalidInput`], so double-revoke is impossible; a caller
//! other than the funder is rejected by host authorization.
//!
//! Revocation is pure state-machine logic: it writes the frozen amount and
//! the status and moves no tokens. The frozen remainder is settled through
//! the same SEP-41 transfer path as any other claim (issue #50), and the
//! unvested remainder stays custodied by the contract — refunding it to the
//! funder is settlement logic out of scope here. Revocation adds no storage
//! keys or tiers (issue #55). There is no tranche `revoke`: a tranche table
//! is immutable and fully pre-funded by construction, and an unmet future
//! tranche already never unlocks.
//!
//! ## Upgrade compatibility
//!
//! Adding the funder/revocation fields to the stored linear record is a
//! **storage-breaking upgrade**, following the pattern documented in
//! `docs/contracts/vesting.md`:
//!
//! - `VestingSchedule` gained `funder: Address` and `revoked_vested:
//!   Option<i128>`. Under
//!   Soroban's `#[contracttype]` encoding every struct field is a required
//!   key, so records written by a pre-revocation build do **not**
//!   deserialize into the new type: a deployed contract must migrate or
//!   reset its instance storage when upgrading, and `create_schedule`
//!   callers must add the `funder` argument.
//! - The storage keys (`DataKey::Schedule(u64)`,
//!   `DataKey::TrancheSchedule(u64)`, `DataKey::Count`), the instance-only
//!   storage tier, and the shared id space are unchanged, so the SEP-41
//!   settlement path (issue #50) and the persistent-storage/TTL migration
//!   (issue #55) are unaffected.
//! - `claimable`, `get_status`, `get_schedule`, and `get_tranche_schedule`
//!   are read-only views.
//!
//! ## Settlement (load-bearing)
//!
//! The contract custodies the configured SEP-41 token and `claim` settles
//! through it: the newly claimable amount is transferred from this contract
//! to the beneficiary, and the schedule is written only after that transfer
//! succeeds. The transfer-before-state ordering mirrors
//! `crates/escrow/src/lib.rs` — a failed transfer (empty contract balance,
//! undeployed token) returns [`ForgeError::TokenTransferFailed`] with
//! `claimed` and `status` untouched. A zero-claim call exits before the
//! transfer, so no empty transfers are ever issued. Soroban's frame rollback
//! is the outer atomicity guarantee: any `Err` returned from `claim` reverts
//! the whole invocation, including sub-invocations.
