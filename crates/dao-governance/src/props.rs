//! Randomized invariant suite (proptest).
//!
//! The hand-written suite in `tests` (lib.rs) pins behaviour on known values;
//! this module tries to *falsify* the governance contract's vote-counting and
//! lifecycle claims over generated inputs. Three properties are exercised:
//!
//! **P1 — Vote tally.** For a generated bounded sequence of vote actions over
//! a fixed voter pool:
//!
//! ```text
//! for_votes + against_votes == sum of balances for distinct voters who successfully voted
//! ```
//!
//! The generator can produce repeated pool indices, which the contract rejects
//! as duplicate votes with `ForgeError::InvalidInput` (not a host abort).
//! The test counts only the actions that actually landed and asserts the tally
//! matches exactly. This proves the contract never double-counts, drops a
//! valid vote, or miscategorises for/against.
//!
//! **P2 — Deadline / lifecycle.** A proposal that has not yet passed its
//! `voting_ends` timestamp must remain `Active` and must not be finalisable:
//! `execute` before the deadline returns `ForgeError::InvalidInput` and the
//! proposal stays `Active`. The deadline is exercised using the actual
//! `Ledger::set_timestamp` mechanism used by the existing tests.
//!
//! **Soroban host limitation note.** The Soroban test environment has no
//! automatic time advancement; only explicit `set_timestamp` calls move the
//! clock. There is no way to exercise a "voting window that closes mid-
//! sequence" without controlling time from test code. The invariant therefore
//! probes the exact boundary: at `voting_ends - 1` the proposal is still
//! `Active` and `execute` is rejected; the post-deadline path is covered
//! comprehensively by P3. This mirrors the approach used by the existing
//! governance tests in lib.rs.
//!
//! **P3 — Finalization outcome.** After voting ends, `execute` must produce:
//!
//! ```text
//! for_votes > against_votes → Succeeded
//! for_votes <= against_votes → Defeated   (includes ties and zero-vote proposals)
//! ```
//!
//! Specifically:
//! - 0 for / 0 against → `Defeated`
//! - equal for / against → `Defeated`
//! - strict for majority → `Succeeded`
//! - strict against majority → `Defeated`
//!
//! Four deterministic companion unit tests pin each boundary case explicitly
//! (see end of file), complementing the randomized P3 suite.
//!
//! **P5 — Failure-sequence bond conservation.** Randomized sequences mixing
//! the three bond custody paths (pull, refund, forfeit) with the two
//! terminal bond moves (execute, cancel), driven into territory where the
//! transfer itself fails:
//!
//! ```text
//! treasury_balance + Σ refunded bond_amounts + contract custody
//!     == proposal_count * BOND
//! ```
//!
//! The equation is asserted on the real SAC after **every** action, not
//! only at the end of the sequence, via [`World::assert_balance_invariant`].
//!
//! **Failed-pull purity.** A bond pull that fails must leave no residue:
//! no proposal record, no consumed id, no movement of the custody total,
//! and no movement of any SAC balance. Retrying the same proposer with
//! exactly the bond then succeeds and leaves a zero balance.
//!
//! All properties run against a real Stellar Asset Contract for bond custody.
//! Runs are deterministic (fixed strategy bounds, proptest's default seed);
//! a failure prints its case seed for replay. Override the case count with
//! `PROPTEST_CASES=n cargo test -p soroban-forge-dao-governance props`.
