//! # Soroban Forge — DAO Governance contract
//!
//! A minimal on-chain governance primitive: members create proposals, cast one
//! vote each (`for`/`against`, tallied in governance-token units), and a
//! proposal is finalised once voting ends — passing when it has a strict
//! majority of `for` votes.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!
//! ```text
//! propose (voting_ends = now + duration)
//!   --> Active --vote × n--> voting ends
//!   --> execute: for > against ? Succeeded : Defeated
//!   --> execute (on Succeeded): target.execute(action) --> Executed (terminal)
//!   --> cancel (proposer only): Cancelled (terminal)
//! ```
//!
//! When voting ends, calling `execute` finalises the vote tally:
//! - If `for_votes > against_votes`, the proposal becomes `Succeeded`.
//! - Otherwise, the proposal becomes `Defeated`.
//!
//! Once a proposal is `Succeeded`, calling `execute` performs a real
//! cross-contract call (`target.execute(action)`) using `env.try_invoke_contract`.
//! - If the target invocation succeeds, the proposal transitions to `Executed`.
//! - If the target invocation reverts, `ForgeError::ContractInvocationFailed` is
//!   returned and the proposal remains in the `Succeeded` state (not `Executed`),
//!   leaving target state unchanged and allowing execution to be re-attempted.
//!
//! `Defeated`, `Executed`, `Cancelled`, and still-`Active` proposals cannot be
//! executed; a second `execute` on an `Executed` proposal is rejected.
//!
//! ## Proposal bonds (token custody)
//!
//! Proposals are not free. Once the bond is configured (see
//! [`DaoGovernance::configure_bond`]), every `propose` pulls `amount` of the
//! configured SEP-41 `token` from the proposer into this contract's custody
//! *before* any state is written. The bond is released exactly once, on the
//! proposal's terminal transition:
//!
//! ```text
//! configure_bond (one-time): token + amount + treasury
//! propose      --transfer--> proposer -> contract   (BondPosted)
//! execute      (Succeeded -> Executed) -> refund    contract -> proposer
//! cancel       (Active -> Cancelled)   -> refund    contract -> proposer
//! execute      (Active -> Defeated)    -> forfeit   contract -> treasury
//! ```
//!
//! - **Refunded** to the proposer: `Executed` (the proposal passed and was
//!   dispatched) and `Cancelled` (the proposer withdrew it).
//! - **Forfeited** to the configured treasury: `Defeated` (the vote failed).
//!
//! Design decisions (both answered in favour of "no new privileged role"):
//! - *Where does a forfeited bond go?* To a **treasury address fixed at
//!   configuration time**. An arbitrary SEP-41 token cannot be burned, and
//!   parking forfeits inside the contract forever would need a privileged
//!   sweep entrypoint (and would keep the contract non-empty after every
//!   proposal is terminal).
//! - *Who sets the bond?* A **one-time, permissionless `configure_bond`**,
//!   mirroring the multi-sig wallet's `initialize`: the deployer calls it in
//!   the deploy transaction and the configuration is immutable afterwards, so
//!   no admin key exists. Per-proposal self-serve bond amounts were rejected:
//!   a proposer who picks their own amount defeats the anti-spam purpose.
//!
//! An unconfigured contract rejects `propose` with
//! [`ForgeError::NotInitialized`] — bond-less proposals are never accepted,
//! so a deployment that forgets to configure is unusable rather than
//! spam-prone.
//!
//! ## Ordering discipline (load-bearing)
//!
//! Every path that moves bonds follows `crates/escrow/src/lib.rs`: the token
//! transfer runs **first**, state is written **after** it succeeds. A failing
//! transfer reverts the whole invocation with storage untouched — including,
//! on `Executed`, the target dispatch — so there is no state/ledger
//! divergence window. Token failures are bucketed into
//! [`ForgeError::TokenTransferFailed`], never forwarded.
//!
//! Double release is structurally impossible: the bond moves in the same
//! frame as the one and only terminal state transition of the proposal, and
//! every terminal transition is state-gated. A failed release surfaces its
//! error with the proposal still in its pre-transition state (retryable).
//!
//! Authorization model:
//! - `configure_bond` is permissionless and callable exactly once.
//! - `propose` requires the proposer; their signature covers the nested
//!   bond pull.
//! - `vote` requires the voter and is one-vote-per-voter per proposal.
//! - `execute` may be called by anyone (permissionless), but only once voting
//!   has ended — including on paths that pay out or forfeit a bond; contract
//!   self-authorization covers the outgoing transfer.
//! - `cancel_proposal` requires the original proposer and freezes a
//!   not-yet-executed proposal; the refund runs in that same call.
//! - `get_proposal` and `get_bond_config` are read-only views.
//!
//! The `Queued` state is reserved for an optional timelock that lands in a
//! follow-up; it is not reachable through the current public interface.
//! Weighted voting by governance-token balance is intentionally out of
//! scope for this iteration: the contract tracks proposals, votes, and timing,
//! not balances. A bond is custody, not vote weight — it never enters the
//! tally (weighted voting is tracked separately as issue #59).
