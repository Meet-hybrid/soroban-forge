#![no_std]

//! Shared testing utilities for Soroban Forge contracts.
//!
//! Provides lightweight helpers used by contract integration tests:
//! - [`new_env`] to construct a configured [`Env`]
//! - [`TestAccounts`] to obtain deterministic, distinct mock addresses
//!
//! This crate is intended to be used as a `dev-dependency` by contract crates.

/// Enables [`Env::mock_all_auths`], which lets tests invoke authorised
/// contract functions without manually signing every call. Tests that need to
/// assert authorisation failures should call [`Env::set_auths`] / disable
/// mocking explicitly.
