/// Test scenario: Multi-sig wallet funds an escrow contract.

/// This is a placeholder for the full implementation. The complete test
/// would verify cross-contract composition between multi-sig and escrow.
///
/// Flow would be:
/// 1. Multi-sig wallet is initialized with owners and threshold
/// 2. Wallet receives token deposits 
/// 3. Owners submit and approve a withdrawal to fund an escrow
/// 4. Escrow is initialized and receives the funds
/// 5. Verify balances and state consistency

    // TODO: Implement full multi-sig to escrow composition test
    // This requires:
    // 1. Deploy both multi-sig and escrow contracts
    // 2. Initialize multi-sig with owners and threshold
    // 3. Fund the multi-sig wallet with tokens
    // 4. Submit withdrawal transaction targeting escrow
    // 5. Collect confirmations from owners
    // 6. Execute withdrawal to fund escrow
    // 7. Verify balances and state consistency
    
    // For MVP, this establishes the test structure
