//! # Soroban Forge — Marketplace Royalties contract
//!
//! Enforces creator royalty splits on secondary sales: when an NFT changes
//! hands, the sale proceeds are split between the seller and one or more
//! royalty recipients according to configured basis-point rates. This
//! iteration stores one royalty configuration per collection, with a single
//! recipient; `settle_sale` moves the computed split in real SEP-41 tokens.
//!
//! Flow:
//!
//! ```text
//! set_royalty(collection, recipient, bps)   -> Active config
//! distribute(collection, seller, amount)    -> computes `amount * bps / 10_000`
//!                                              for the recipient and returns
//!                                              the net owed to the seller
//! settle_sale(collection, token, payer,
//!             seller, amount)               -> transfers the seller net, then
//!                                              the royalty share, then commits
//!                                              the settlement totals
//! settle_sales(collection, token, payer,
//!              sales: Vec<(seller, amount)>) -> validates the whole batch
//!                                              (config, cap, every amount,
//!                                              aggregate split math) before
//!                                              any token moves, runs each
//!                                              sale's seller-then-recipient
//!                                              transfers in sale order, and
//!                                              commits the aggregate totals
//!                                              exactly once
//! ```
//!
//! Authorization model:
//! - `set_royalty` requires the collection (the contract whose config this
//!   is), and `bps` must not exceed 100% (10_000 bps).
//! - `distribute` requires the collection and returns the seller's net after
//!   the configured royalty split; a `Disabled` configuration settles in full
//!   to the seller. It computes only and moves no tokens.
//! - `settle_sale` requires the collection (as `distribute` does) and the
//!   `payer`, whose balance funds both transfers; the payer's authorization
//!   covers the nested token invocations exactly as escrow's does.
//! - `settle_sales` has the same trust model as `settle_sale`: one
//!   collection authorization and one payer authorization cover every
//!   nested token transfer in the batch — no per-sale re-authorization.
//! - `get_royalty` and `get_settlement_summary` are read-only views.
//!
//! Settlement follows escrow's transfer-before-state ordering: both token
//! transfers run before any settlement state is committed, the royalty
//! recipient is paid last so a failed transfer can never leave it partially
//! paid, and token failures are bucketed into `TokenTransferFailed`. Any
//! returned error rolls the whole invocation back. `settle_sales` extends
//! that discipline to the batch: every fallible step (configuration load,
//! the [`MAX_SETTLE_SALES`] cap, per-sale `amount > 0`, the per-sale split
//! math, and the aggregate check against the stored summary) runs before
//! the first transfer, the summary is written once per call, and a failure
//! in any sale — including a later sale's transfer — reverts the entire
//! invocation, so no sale in the batch is ever half-settled. Multiple
//! recipients per collection and per-token royalties remain out of scope
//! for this iteration.
