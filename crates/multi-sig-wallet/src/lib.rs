//! # Soroban Forge — Multi-signature Wallet contract
//!
//! A wallet that requires `threshold` approvals from a set of owners before a
//! transaction executes. The wallet is configured once via
//! [`SorobanForgeMultiSigWallet::initialize`]; transactions submitted by an
//! owner then collect confirmations from other owners until the threshold is
//! met, at which point [`SorobanForgeMultiSigWallet::execute`] completes them.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!
//! ```text
//! submit --(confirm × n)--> threshold met --execute--> Executed
//! submit --(reject × n)--> rejection threshold met --> Rejected (terminal)
//! submit_withdrawal --(confirm × n)--> threshold met --execute--> Executed (+ tokens moved)
//! submit_withdrawal --(reject × n)--> rejection threshold met --> Rejected (terminal)
//! ```
//!
//! Authorization model:
//! - `initialize` sets the owner set and threshold once (guarded against
//!   re-initialisation).
//! - `submit` requires an owner and records a `target` contract address
//!   and an opaque `payload` for cross-contract invocation.
//! - `confirm` requires an owner that has not confirmed already.
//! - `reject` requires an owner that has not already signalled on the tx.
//! - `execute` may be called by anyone; it only succeeds once the threshold is
//!   met. For opaque-payload txs it performs a real cross-contract
//!   invocation to the recorded `target`. For typed withdrawal txs it moves
//!   real tokens.
//! - A target revert surfaces as [`ForgeError::ContractInvocationFailed`]
//!   and leaves the transaction un-executed (status stays `Pending`).
//!
//! ## Rejection policy
//!
//! An owner who spots a malicious or mistaken pending transaction records a
//! formal objection via `reject`. Rejections are stored on the tx record
//! (`WalletTx::rejections`) alongside confirmations. The policy:
//!
//! - **A signed owner may signal once, in one direction.** An owner who
//!   confirmed cannot also reject the same tx, and an owner who rejected
//!   cannot confirm it (`InvalidInput`). A combined signal would be
//!   ambiguous.
//! - **Existing confirmations do not block rejection.** The whole point of
//!   the entrypoint is to stop a tx that already reached (or is approaching)
//!   the threshold, so an owner can reject a tx others have confirmed.
//! - **Any rejection blocks execution.** `execute` refuses a tx that carries
//!   even one rejection, below or at the threshold — a single formal
//!   objection stalls the tx. That is load-bearing: without it, rejections
//!   below the threshold would be a no-op and a threshold-met malicious tx
//!   would still execute.
//! - **Reaching the threshold is terminal.** Once `rejections.len() >=
//!   threshold` the status flips to `Rejected`: no further confirms,
//!   executes, or rejects are accepted.
//! - **Executed txs can never be rejected** (there is nothing to stop), and
//!   rejections are never revoked (un-confirm is out of scope).
//!
//! ## Custody model
//!
//! The wallet custodies SEP-41 token balances. Anyone (an owner or a
//! third party) can `deposit` into the wallet by pull transfer; only a
//! threshold-approved withdrawal can move funds out. Open deposits are a
//! deliberate choice: a wallet that can only receive from its owners is a
//! strict subset of one that accepts direct funding, and custody risk is
//! unchanged because every exit is multisig-gated. The wallet must be
//! initialized before deposits are accepted — funding an uninitialized
//! wallet would strand the tokens behind a contract with no owners and no
//! exit.
//!
//! A withdrawal is a transaction like any other: `submit_withdrawal` records
//! a typed [`Withdrawal`] (token, destination, amount) as a `Pending` tx that
//! collects confirmations; `execute` moves the tokens to the destination and
//! flips the status only past the threshold. Withdrawal validity is checked
//! at execution time, not submission time — the balance can change between
//! the two, so a submitted withdrawal is an intent, not a reservation.
//!
//! Two transaction kinds coexist by design:
//! - **Opaque-payload txs** (`submit`) keep the `payload` `Bytes` untouched
//!   for arbitrary transaction bodies; dispatching those bytes is out of
//!   scope here.
//! - **Typed withdrawal txs** (`submit_withdrawal`) carry an empty `payload`
//!   and a [`TxKind::Withdrawal`] record instead. Encoding withdrawals into
//!   the opaque payload was rejected because the contract would need a
//!   payload codec to validate and execute them natively; a typed record
//!   lets the contract validate amount/destination semantics directly and
//!   keeps the `payload` free for genuinely arbitrary txs. The tradeoff is
//!   that withdrawals are a first-class tx kind rather than uninterpreted
//!   bytes.
//!
//! ## Ordering discipline (load-bearing)
//!
//! Every method that moves tokens performs the token transfer **first** and
//! writes state **after** the transfer succeeds. A failed transfer reverts
//! the whole invocation with balances and tx state untouched — there is no
//! state/ledger divergence window and no recovery path needed. The inverse
//! ordering (state first, transfer second) would strand funds behind a
//! failed transfer and is the classic custody bug.
//!
//! ## Token trust model
//!
//! `deposit` accepts a user-specified token address. The contract does not
//! verify that the address is a deployed token contract or enforce SEP-41
//! compliance; it assumes the supplied token follows the expected SEP-41
//! interface and behavior. Token transfer failures use the existing
//! `TokenTransferFailed` error path, so a malicious or non-compliant token
//! is an external trust assumption rather than something the wallet
//! validates.
//!
//! ## Storage and TTL
//!
//! Token balances live in **per-token persistent entries**
//! (`DataKey::Balance(token)`), not instance storage, mirroring the escrow
//! crate's rationale: persistent entries scale the byte budget per record
//! instead of taxing every instance read (the owner set, threshold, and tx
//! records) with custody data that grows with the number of custodied
//! tokens, and persistent entries carry their own extensible TTL so a
//! long-idle balance does not silently expire the way archived instance
//! storage would force a full-state restore. Every balance write bumps the
//! entry's TTL with the standard threshold/extend pattern, and `touch_ttl`
//! is a permissionless keeper entrypoint for balances that sit idle near
//! expiry. The `Owners`/`Threshold`/`Count`/`Tx` keys stay in instance
//! storage: they are small, hot, written by the existing entrypoints, and
//! their semantics are unchanged by this custody layer.

// WASM target guard: SDK 27 contracts must be built for wasm32v1-none.
// wasm32-unknown-unknown (os=unknown) can emit features the Soroban
// runtime rejects; wasm32v1-none (os=none) is the supported target.
